Please read this Agreement carefully before using the Services.  By using the website [http://customer.io](http://customer.io) (the “Site”), and applications, features and other content (collectively, the “Services”) offered by Peaberry Software Inc. (“Customer.io”), you signify your assent to become bound by the terms and conditions of this Agreement.  If you do not agree to all the terms and conditions of this Agreement, you do not have any right to use the Services.
 
The Services, owned and operated by Customer.io, collect user and usage data to enable website and application owners to send e-mail messages efficiently to consumers based on their behavior. This Agreement applies to all users of the Services. Your use of the Services is an acknowledgment that you understand and agree to be bound by this Agreement, any fees applicable to you, any additional guidelines, Customer.io's [Privacy Policy](/privacy-policy.html) and [Anti-Spam Policy](/anti-spam-policy.html), and any future modifications of this Agreement.  

The Services are accessed by you (“User” or “you”) under the following terms and conditions: 

### 1. ACCESS TO THE SERVICES

Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Customer.io may provide the Services, which are selected by you, solely for your own use, and not for the use or benefit of any third party.  Services shall include, but not be limited to, the offering of any materials displayed or performed on the Site and related features (including, but not limited to text, data, software, graphics, photographs, images, illustrations, audio clips and video clips, also known as the “Content”).  Customer.io may change, suspend or discontinue the Services for any reason, at any time, including the availability of any feature or Content.  Customer.io may also restrict your access to parts or all of the Services without notice or liability. Customer.io may modify this Agreement at any time by posting a notice on the Services, or by sending you a notice via e-mail or postal mail.  You shall be responsible for reviewing and becoming familiar with any such modifications.  Your use of the Services following such notification constitutes your acceptance of the terms and conditions of this Agreement as modified. If at any time you do not agree to these terms and conditions, you must terminate your use of the Services. You will still remain liable for any obligations incurred or charges accrued on or before the date of termination.

You certify to Customer.io that if you are an individual (i.e., not a corporation) you are at least 18 years of age.  You also certify that you are legally permitted to use the Services and access the Site. If you are entering into this Agreement on behalf of a company or other legal entity, you represent and warrant that you have the authority to bind such entity to this agreement, in which case the terms “you” or “your” shall refer to such entity. This Agreement is void where prohibited by law, and the right to use the Services is revoked in such jurisdictions.  

Customer.io will use reasonable efforts to ensure that the Services are available twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week. However, there will be occasions when the Services will be interrupted for maintenance, upgrades and emergency repairs or due to failure of telecommunications links and equipment. Every reasonable step will be taken by Customer.io to minimize such disruption where it is within Customer.io’s reasonable control. Customer.io will not be liable in any event to you or any other party for any suspension, modification, discontinuance or lack of availability of the Site, the Services, your Customer Data or Results (as defined herein) or other content.

### 2. CONTENT

You shall not store any significant portion of the Content in any form.  Copying or storing of any Content for other than personal, noncommercial use is expressly prohibited without prior written permission from Customer.io, or from the copyright holder identified in such Content's copyright notice.  All trademarks, service marks, and trade names which appear on the Services are proprietary to Customer.io or third parties. You shall abide by all copyright notices and restrictions contained in any Content accessed through the Services.

The Services are protected by copyright as a collective work and/or compilation, pursuant to U.S. and other copyright laws.  Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Customer.io grants you a nonexclusive, nontransferable right and license (without right to sublicense) to access and use the Services, solely for your internal business purposes. You may not (except as provided in this Section of this Agreement) modify, publish, transmit, participate in the transfer or sale of, reproduce, create derivative works based on, distribute, perform, display, or in any way exploit, any of the Content, software, materials, or Services in whole or in part.


### 3. CUSTOMER DATA

You acknowledge and agree that if you provide data regarding your end users or e-mail campaigns to Customer.io in connection with your use of the Services (“Customer Data”), you hereby do and shall grant Customer.io a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free, transferable right to use, modify, reproduce, and display such Customer Data (including all related intellectual property rights) to (i) provide the Services and (ii) improve the Services’ ability to deliver web and application analytics services to you. You warrant, represent and agree that you have the right to grant Customer.io the rights set forth above.

If you disclose Customer Data which includes personally identifiable information (“PII”) of end users of your site or application (“Customer Site”) to Customer.io, you represent and warrant that: (i) you comply with all applicable laws relating to the collection, use and disclosure of PII on your Customer Site; (ii) you have posted and maintain a privacy policy on your Customer Site, which clearly and conspicuously discloses that: (a) you use third-party service providers to provide services to you in connection with your operation of your Customer Site, including the collection and tracking of certain data and information regarding the characteristics and activities of visitors to such Customer Site; and (b) you may disclose end user PII to certain such third-party service providers in connection with their provision of services to you; and (iii) you have made all required notifications and obtained all required consents and authorizations from your end users relating to the disclosure of end user PII to a third party service provider like Customer.io. You further acknowledge and agree that your indemnity obligation under the “Indemnity” section below applies to your disclosure of end user PII under this Agreement.

Customer.io reserves the right to remove any Customer Data from the Site and the Services at any time, for any reason or for no reason at all. Customer.io may, but is not obligated to, monitor Customer Data and remove any content or prohibit any use of the Services, including by refusing to send e-mail to your end users, if Customer.io believes in its sole discretion such content or use may be (or is alleged to be) in violation of these Terms of Service or any applicable laws or may impact delivery. All information transmitted through the Services is the sole responsibility of the party from whom such information originated. Customer.io does not assume liability for any Customer Data. You are responsible for all Customer Data submitted under your account, including Customer Data contributed by a third party under your account.

Any feedback relating to the Services (“Feedback”) submitted to Customer.io shall become the property of Customer.io. Customer.io will not be required to treat any Feedback as confidential, and will not be liable for any ideas or incur any liability as a result of any similarities that may appear in our future Services, or operations. 

### 4. RESULTS

Results are works made for hire to the extent allowed by law, and Customer.io makes all assignments to you necessary to accomplish the foregoing ownership.  You hereby grant Customer.io a limited, non-exclusive right (i) to disclose your Results to Customer.io’s employees and agents solely as required for them to provide Customer.io with their products and services, and (ii) to disclose your Results to comply with court order, law, or direction by a governmental or regulatory agency (in which event, Customer.io will use reasonable efforts to provide prior written notice to you of such disclosure and the opportunity to object to such disclosure or to seek confidential treatment of such data), and (iii) to use your Results to operate, manage, and maintain the Services, and to improve the Services’ ability to deliver web and application analytics services to you.  Customer.io may compile and analyze Results and prepare reports and other work product using the aggregate Results compiled from you and other customers.
